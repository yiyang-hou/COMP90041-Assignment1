# The University of Melborne - Master of IT - COMP90041 - Assignment 1

This repository contains my submission for assignment 1 of the subject COMP90041 Programming and Software Development.

The goal of this assignment is to implement a simple console drawing program in Java.
<p>Specifically, given some parameters (e.g., side length, alignment settings), the program draws isosceles right-angled triangles and squares on a drawing canvas. The program will also have a certain capability to implement some simple transformations like rotation and zooming and perform simple error checking.</p>
